QjackCtl - JACK Audio Connection Kit Qt GUI Interface
-----------------------------------------------------

ChangeLog


0.5.1  2018-05-21  Pre-LAC2018 release frenzy.

- Half a decade later, recent new custom entries may now get
  removed from Session Infra-client list.

- Some rather old, better said "Cambric explosion era", user
  preference options have been ditched altogether: Display /
  Time Format; Display / Shiny glass light effect; Display /
  Connections/Draw connections and patchbay lines as Bezier
  curves; Misc/Configure as temporary server.

- A brand new and way long overdue connections Graph widget
  is finally introduced, only to be accessible through the
  context menu at this time.

- Extended multi-selection is now supported on all Connections
  client/port lists, allowing for multiple (dis)connections at
  once.

- Disable singleton/unique application instance setup logic
  when the display server platform is not X11.

- A little hardening on the configure (autoconf) macro side.


0.5.0  2017-12-16  End of Autum'17 release.

- Current preset is always taken into account if ever changes
  while the Setup dialog is hidden (eg. via context menu).

- Desktop entry specification file is now finally independent
  from build/configure template chains.

- Updated target path for freedesktop.org's AppStream metainfo
  file (formerly AppData).


0.4.5  2017-04-27  Pre-LAC2017 release frenzy.

- On some desktop-shells, the system tray icon blinking on
  XRUN ocurrences, have been found responsible to excessive
  CPU usage, an "eye-candy" effect which is now optional as
  far as Setup/Display/Blink server mode indicator goes.

- Added French man page (by Olivier Humbert, thanks).

- Make builds reproducible byte for byte, by getting rid of
  the configure build date and time stamps.


0.4.4  2016-11-14  A Fall'16 release.

- Fixed an early crash when the singleton/unique application
  instance setup option is turned off.

- Almost complete overhaul on the configure script command
  line options, wrt. installation directories specification,
  eg. --prefix, --bindir, --libdir, --datadir and --mandir.


0.4.3  2016-09-14  End of Summer'16 release.

- Fix build error caused by variable length array.

- Fix some tooltip spelling (patch by Jaromír Mikeš, thanks). 

- Translation (not) fix for the default server name "(default)".

- Old "Start minimized to system tray" option returns to setup.

- Dropped the --enable-qt5 from configure as found redundant
  given that's the build default anyway (suggestion by Guido
  Scholz, while for Qtractor, thanks).

- Late again French (fr) translation update (by Olivier Humbert
  aka. trebmuh, thanks).


0.4.2  2016-04-05  Spring'16 release frenzy.

- Added a brand new "Enable JACK D-BUS interface" option, split
  from the old common "Enable D-BUS interface" setup option which
  now refers to its own self D-BUS interface exclusively.

- Dropped old "Start minimized to system tray" option from setup.

- Add double-click action (toggle start/stop) to systray (a pull
  request by Joel Moberg, thanks).

- Added application keywords to freedesktop.org's AppData.

- System-tray icon context menu has been fixed/hacked to show up
  again on Plasma 5 (aka. KDE5) notification status area.

- Switched column entries in the unified interface device combo-
  box to make it work for macosx/coreaudio again.

- Blind fix to a FTBFS on macosx/coreaudio platforms, a leftover
  from the unified interface device selection combo-box inception,
  almost two years ago.

- Prevent x11extras module from use on non-X11/Unix plaforms.

- Late French (fr) translation update (by Olivier Humbert, thanks).


0.4.1  2015-10-28  A Fall'15 release.

- Probing portaudio audio device in a separate thread (by Kjetil
  Matheussen, thanks).

- Messages standard output capture has been improved again, now
  in both ways a non-blocking pipe may get.

- Regression fix for invalid system-tray icon dimensions reported
  by some desktop environment frameworks.

- New hi-res application icon (by Uttrup Renzel, Max Christian
  Pohle, thanks).

- System tray icon red background now blinks when a XRUN occurs.

- Desktop environment session shutdown/logout management has been
  also adapted to Qt5 framework.

- Single/unique application instance control adapted to Qt5/X11.

- Prefer Qt5 over Qt4 by default with configure script.

- Overrideable tooltips with latency info (re. Connections JACK
  client/ports: patch by Xavier Mendez, thanks).

- Complete rewrite of Qt4 vs. Qt5 configure builds.

- French (fr) translation update (by Olivier Humbert, thanks).


0.4.0  2015-07-15  Summer'15 release frenzy.

- Some windows fixes added (patch by Kjetil Matheussen, thanks).

- Most advanced Setup/Settings are moved into new Setup/Advanced
  settings tab; limit range for the real-time priority setting,
  now having 6 as absolute minimum valid value (after patches by
  Robin Gareus, thanks).

- A new top-level widget window geometry state save and restore
  sub-routine is now in effect.

- Delayed geometry setup for widget windows upon startup has
  been deprecated and scrapped altogether.

- Setup/settings dialog tab is going into some layout changes;
  also got rid of old patchbay auto-refresh timer cruft, which
  was previously hidden/disabled.

- New socket names are now automatically inferred from selected
  client names while on the Patchbay widget, Socket dialog.

- Fixed for some strict tests for Qt4 vs. Qt5 configure builds.

- German (de) translation update (by Guido Scholz, thanks).


0.3.13  2015-03-25  Pre-LAC2015 release frenzy.

- Added application description as freedesktop.org's AppData.

- Setup dialog form is now modeless.

- Introducing brand new active patchbay reset/disconnect-all
  user preference option.

- Current highlighted client/port connections are now drawn
  with thicker connector lines.

- New user preference option on whether to show the nagging
  'program will keep running in the system tray' message, on
  main window close.

- Connections lines now drawn with anti-aliasing; connections
  splitter handles width is now reduced.

- Drop missing or non-existent patchbay definition files from
  the most recent used list.


0.3.12  2014-10-19  JACK Pretty-names aliasing.

- JACK client/port pretty-name (metadata) support is being
  introduced and seamlessly integrated with old Connections
  client/port aliases editing (rename) (refactored from an
  original patch by Paul Davis, thanks).

- Application close confirm warning is now raising the main
  window as visible and active for due top level display,
  especially applicable when minimized to the system tray.

- Messages standard output capture has been slightly improved
  as for non-blocking i/o, whenever available.

- Translations install directory change.

- Allow the build system to include an user specified LDFLAGS.

- Missing input/output-latency parameter settings now settled
  for the D-BUS controlled JACK server and firewire back-end
  driver.


0.3.11  2013-12-31  A fifth of a Jubilee.

- More preparations for Qt5 configure build.

- Interface device selection is now unified, by moving the old 
  '>' pop-up menu into the customized combo-box drop-down list
  showing all available card/device names and descriptions (on
  a patch by Arnout Engelen, thanks).

- Added include <unistd.h> to shut up gcc 4.7 build failures
  (patch by Alexis Ballier, thanks).


0.3.10  2013-04-01  The singing swan rehersal.

- Session infra-client management finally being added.

- Preparations for Qt5 migration.

- Transport tempo (BPM) precision display fixed to 4 digits.

- Color-candy (dang old ANSI terminal?) escape sequences are
  now silently stripped from jackdbus messages captured log
  (onliner from original patch by Brendan Jones, thanks).

- List ALSA device card id. string instead of device number,
  while on setup dialog.

- Japanese (ja) translation added (by Takashi Sakamoto).


0.3.9  2012-05-18  The last of the remnants.

- Killing D-BUS controlled JACK server is now made optional,
  cf. Setup/Misc/Stop JACK audio server on application exit.
  (a patch by Roland Mas, thanks).

- Added include <unistd.h> to shut up gcc 4.7 build failures.

- Make(ing) -jN parallel builds now available for the masses.

- A mis-quoting bug at the command line argument string may
  have been crippling the (unmaintained) Windows port since
  ever, leaving its main function to start jackd dead in the
  water, belly down :) now hopefully fixed (following a mail
  transaction with Stephane Letz and Mathias Nagorni, thanks).

- Currently a JACK2-only feature, the JACK version string
  display at the About dialog box, must now be explicitly
  enabled on configure time (--enable-jack-version).

- A new so called "Server Suffix" parameter option appears
  to rescue on the situations where QjackCtl falls short on
  extra, exquisite and/or esoteric command line options eg.
  (net)jack1/2 differences.

- Fixed D-Bus Input/Output device parameter settings, filled
  when either interface is selected for Capture/Playback only.
  (probable fix for bug #3441860).

- Fixed Makefile.in handling of installation directories to
  the configure script eg. --datadir, --localedir, --mandir.
  (after an original patch from h3xx, thanks).

- Main window is now brought to front and (re)activated when
  clicking on the system tray icon instead of just hiding it.

- Add current xrun count to the system tray icon tooltip, if
  not zero (after patch #3314633 by Colin Fletcher, thanks).


0.3.8  2011-07-01  JACK Session versioning.

- Debugging stacktrace now applies to all working threads.

- Session "Save" button now a drop-down menu, replacing the
  session save type combo-box/drop-down list selection. Also,
  an early session directory versioning/numbering scheme is
  now in place, although optional.

- Probable fix to debian bug report #624198 - segfault when
  pressing the stop button (by Grant Adrian Diffey, after a
  patch from Adrian Knoth, thanks).

- Desktop environment session shutdown (eg. logout) is now
  tapped for graceful application exit, even though the main
  window is active (visible) and minimizing to system tray
  is enabled. Both were causing first shutdown/logout attempt
  to abort. Not anymore, hopefully ;).

- Make sure all activated patchbay definition files are in
  their complete and absolute directory path forms.

- Connections refresh button now does an immediate and true
  reconstruction of all clients and their respective ports
  and connections, unconditionally.

- Command line server start option (-s, --start) is now made
  independent from configuration setup option (cf. Setup/Misc
  /Start JACK audio server on application startup).

- Now handling cable socket types properly to let patchbay
  definitions work correctly, whenever having sockets with
  the very same literal name (twisted from patch #3183467,
  by Karsten, thanks;).

- Abrupt focus behavior when any of the keyboard modifiers
  (Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Caps Lock) is hit while on Connections
  client/port aliases editing (rename) has been fixed.

- Russian (ru) translation updated (by Alexandre Prokoudine).

- Added include "errno.h" alegedly missing for BSD style
  systems (applying patch for bug #3126091).


0.3.7  2010-11-30  JACK Session managerism.

- Session widget has session save type preserved as well.

- Connections and the new Messages/Status widgets now have
  their last open tab preserved across program run-cycles.

- Connections and Patchbay widgets have been finally given
  up on an old feature request: an Expand All items button.

- A significant UI layout has been made: the Messages and
  Status widgets were merged into one, giving space to the
  brand new Session wigdet to be easy accessible from the
  main panel control window.

- libX11 is now being added explicitly to the build link
  phase, as seen necessary on some bleeding-edge distros
  eg. Fedora 13, Debian 6. (closing bug #3050915).

- Input/Output latency options were missing but now finally
  enabled for the firewire back-end.

- General standard dialog buttons layout is now in place.

- Avoid pre-loading a stalled patchbay definition filename
  and its nagging error on startup (fixes bug #3017078).

- Client connection retrial logic scrapped. Being a leftover
  from early ages, when machines were slower and JACK server
  startup times were longer... now, if it can't connect first
  time as client, it will tear down the server whether it's
  starting up still or not at all. (cf. Setup/Settings/Start
  Delay for the rescue).

- Server name is finally part of the server settings presets,
  thanks to Fons Adriaensen for the heads-up.

- As a workaround regarding issues switching jack2's backends,
  Robin Gareus sends us yet another D-Bus method slot: "preset",
  (dbus-send --system / org.rncbc.qjackctl.preset string:PRESET).
  Thanks again.

- Another D-Bus interface slot makes it through implementation:
  "quit" (eg. usage: dbus-send --system / org.rncbc.qjackctl.quit).
  Besides, there's also these new JACK session management actions
  which were being overlooked as well: "load", "save", "savequit"
  and "savetemplate" are also available as D-Bus method slots.

- Make sure that Patchbay socket names are unique when adding
  or copying, fixing previous patch by Dominic Sacre.

- JACK version is now being shown on the About box (jack2).

- Slight Connections widget behavioral change: (dis)connecting a
  client (from) to one single port, (dis)connections will be
  applied in sequence from (to) all client output ports to (from)
  as many input ports there are in below, one by one (satisfying
  a 5 year old request from Yann Orlarey, thanks:).

- JACK session support is being introduced.

- Ignore first XRUN occurrence option dropped from statistics.

- Initial widget geometry and visibility persistence logic has
  been slightly revised as much to avoid crash failures due to
  wrong main widget hidden state.

- Double-quotes are now being added to device names which include
  blank characters and were rendering invalid all command line
  invocation of the classic JACK server (eg. specially due for
  Portaudio device names on Windows).
  
- Transport play (rolling) status is now being guarded to avoid
  backfiring from extraneous transport state changes.

- General source tree layout and build configuration change.

- Italian (it) translation added (by Sergio Atzori).

- Post-shutdown script invocation logic slightly refactored in
  attempt to enforce its execution on application quit.


0.3.6  2010-03-09  Full D-Busification!

- Make sure socket names are unique on each side of the Patchbay
  (another patch from Dominic Sacre, thanks).

- A bunch of primitive D-Bus interface slots have been added,
  allowing shortcut access to most of main applications actions
  like toggling Messages, Status, Connections, Patchbay widget
  pop-ups, reset stats, transport and so on. New bindings are
  given eg. via dbus-send --system / org.rncbc.qjackctl.(main, 
  messages, status, connections, patchbay, setup, about, reset,
  rewind, backward, play, pause, forward). (from an original
  idea from Sebastian Gutsfeld, thanks).

- Patchbay snapshot now tolerates JACK client port strings that
  have more than one semi-colon in it, honoring just the first
  one exactly as everywhere else eg. Connections. (a glitch as
  reported by Geoff Beasley while using a2jmidid).

- Most modal message dialog boxes (eg. critical errors) are now
  replaced by system tray icon bubble messages where available
  (mitigating feature request #2936455).

- Comply with jackd >= 0.118.0 which nowruns in real-time mode by
  default; use of -R is now deprecated from the jackd command line
  interface options; use -r to run in non-real-time-scheduling.

- A man page has beed added.

- Got rid of a pretty old and never really useful "jackd-realtime"
  server path option--actually, it was only seen available on the
  now defunct old Mandrake Linux distro.

- D-Bus support, as provided by org.jackaudio.service aka jackdbus,
  is now being introduced and used wherever available and whenever
  enabled. Configuring, starting, stopping and logging the JACK
  back-end server through the "infamous" jackdbus service is now
  being seamlessly exploited.

- Global configuration state is now explicitly saved/committed to
  disk when Setup dialog changes are accepted and applied.

- Server name command line option added (-n, --server-name).

- Single application instance restriction option added (X11).

- Setup for the netjack (slave) "net" driver has now sample-rate
  and frames per buffer (period size) settings disabled and/or
  ignored, as those are pretty much auto-detected by default;
  also, a new "netone" backend driver option has been introduced
  (as suggested by Torben Hohn).

- Czech (cs) translation added (by Pavel Fric).

- Fixed some main window keyboard shortcuts. Escape key now closes
  Connections, Patchbay, Status and Messages widgets as usual (bug
  #2871548).

- Fixed glitch on configure portaudio support, specially when the
  library is not detected as available.


0.3.5  2009-09-30  Slipped away!

- Late support for UTF-8 encoded client/port names.

- Allow only one single patchbay connection to or from an exclusive
  socket (mitigating bug #2859119).

- Automatic crash-dump reports, debugger stack-traces (gdb), back-
  traces, whatever, are being introduced as a brand new configure
  option (--enable-stacktrace) and default enabled on debug build
  targets (--enable-debug).

- Probable fix on the audio connections with regard to client/port
  (re)name changes (an ancient bug reported by Fons Adriaensen).

- Portaudio device selector is now available (after a patch handed
  by Torben Hohn and Stephane Letz).

- A couple of primitive D-Bus interface slots have been introduced,
  giving the option to start/stop the jackd server from the system
  bus eg. via dbus-send --system / org.rncbc.qjackctl.start (.stop), 
  (a nice addition supplied by Robin Gareus, thanks).

- New command line option (-a, --active-patchbay=[path]) to specify
  and activate a given patchbay definition file (a simple patch sent
  by John Schneiderman, thanks).

- Added one significant digit to DSP Load percentage status display.

- Tentative support for netjack (slave) by adding the "net" driver to
  the existing backend driver options on the Setup/Settings section.

- Converted obsolete QMessageBox forms to standard buttons.

- New patchbay snapshot now raises the dirty flag and allows for the
  immediate salvage of patchbay definition profile.

- Conditional build for JACK port aliases support (JACK >= 0.109.2).

- Alternate icon sizes other than default 16x16, are now effective to
  the Connections widget (Setup/Dislay/Connections Window/Icon size).


0.3.4  2008-12-05  Patchbay snapshot revamp.

- Introducing the very first and complete translations in-package:
  German (de), Spanish (es), French (fr) and Russian (ru); credits
  in TRANSLATORS.

- At last, after years of retarded procrastination, the old infamous
  patchbay snapshot feature has been the subject of a almost complete
  rewrite and it does try to give a way better mapping of all actual
  and current running client/port connections, both JACK (audio, MIDI)
  and ALSA MIDI, of course ;)

- On Setup/Settings/Parameters dialog, all device selection options
  are now reset to default when disabled interactively.

- Grayed/disabled palette color group fix for dark color themes.

- Qt Software logo update.

- Fait-divers: desktop menu file touched to openSUSE conventions.

- ALSA PCM devices now only listed/enumerated iif strictly compliant
  with the audio mode criteria (Duplex, Capture-only or Playback-only)
  as kindly suggested by Nedko Ardaunov.

- JACK client/port aliases may now be displayed as a global user option
  (see Setup/Display/Connections/JACK client/port aliases).

- Lighten up the connections line and highlight colors, as seen to fit
  best on some darker background themes.

- Patchbay snapshot fixed to differentiate socket clients according
  to its type (Audio, MIDI or ALSA-Seq), avoiding the mess and gross
  mistake of hanging disparate type ports under the same client item.

- JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER environment variable is now appended to the X11
  unique application identifier, allowing for having multiple instances
  each controlling its own JACK server, besides the default one.

- Due to some trouble with newer Qt >= 4.4 applications regarding font
  size configuration, a new global user option is now available to the
  rescue: Setup/Misc/Defaults/Base font size (default is no-op).


0.3.3  2008-06-07  Patchbay JACK-MIDI, file logging and X11 uniqueness.

- Attempt to load Qt's own translation support and get rid of
  the ever warning startup message, unless built in debug mode.
  (transaction by Guido Scholz, while on qsynth-devel, thanks).

- Messages file logging makes its first long overdue appearance,
  with user configurable settings in Setup/Options/Logging.

- Only one application instance is now allowed to be up and running,
  with immediate but graceful termination upon startup iif an already
  running instance is detected, which will see its main widget shown
  up and the server started automatically (Qt/X11 platform only).

- Finally, full JACK MIDI support sneaks into the patchbay; socket
  types now differ in Audio, MIDI and ALSA, following the very same
  nomenclature as found on the Connections widget tabs.

- Sun driver support (by Jacob Meuser).

- Delay window positioning at startup option is now being disabled,
  on the Setup/Misc tab, when Minimize to system tray is enabled.

- Cosmetic fix: Setup/Settings tab, 'Input Device' text label was
  using a slightly smaller font than the rest of the application
  (bug#1872545, reported by Jouni Rinne).


0.3.2  2007-12-20  Patchbay heads-up with season greetings.

- Patchbay port matching has been slightly extended, this time
  allowing for the multiple or as many-to-many connections between
  socket plugs, provided these are specified in proper regex form
  (after a patch proposed by Dave Moore, thanks).

- A new option to start the program minimized when the system tray
  icon is enabled, is now available from Setup/Misc/Start minimized
  to system tray (as kindly suggested by Marc-Olivier Barre).

- Regression from QSystemTrayIcon (Qt4 >= 4.2) implementation, at
  least on X11 environments: while the main application widget was
  minimized to the system-tray, closing any other top-level widget
  was causing the immediate and unexpected application shutdown.

- Some portaudio backend settings are now being enabled, specially
  suited for the jackdmp flavouring.

- Server mode display blinking, usually shown as the RT indicator,
  is now an option (Setup/Display/Blink server mode indicator when
  started). 

- Tool/child windows position and size preservation fixed.

- The connections/patchbay auto-refresh option has been finally
  removed due to several user requests, although deprecated for
  quite some time now it has been the probable cause of some
  periodic xrun occurrences due to graph-locking in jackd (while
  making Geoff Beasley angry in the process:).

- Messages line limit was not being checked, now honored.

- Simple as it could ever be, the build executive summary report
  is now given on configure.

- Patchbay snapshot ot its socket and port ordering back.

- ALSA Sequencer support is now an optional feature on setup,
  preventing the annoying "MIDI patchbay will be not available"
  warning message, ruining window placement on Linux systems
  where the snd-midi-seq kernel module is not loaded or not
  favorable (eg. OSS) at startup (by request from Jussi Laako).

- Get configure to try and detect the correct qmake location and
  insert it the search order, so let the qt4 tools take precedence
  when --with-qt option is given and older qt3 ones coexist and
  are found located ahead in the PATH.

- The connections widget is now being properly refreshed, due to
  some quirk in the QTreeWidget which was preventing some items,
  specially the expanded ones, to disappear in the void. Meanwhile,
  with a hand from Stephane Letz, the client/port lookup method was
  changed to prevent duplicated, missing entries or worse, crashes
  due to weird behaved windows applications.

- The xrun count stats can now be reset simply by middle clicking
  on the systray icon or the main window's display area (thanks to
  patch sent by Dominic Sacre).

- An improved version of the "shiny" background image was issued.
  The original somehow looked like two different images put together,
  probably most apparent on a bright TFT screen (by Dominic Sacre).

- A warning is now being issued, asking whether one wants to remove
  a corresponding Patchbay connection, when client/ports are being
  disconnected over the Connections window, thus avoiding automatic
  reconnection annoyance due to normal active Patchbay behavior.

- The infamous "Keep child windows always on top" global option is
  now supposed to behave a little better when disabled, layering
  child windows as naturally as far the window manager dictates.

- Input/Output Channel setting is now allowed to be greater than 32;
  the special default text is now displayed, also on Input/Output
  Latency and Priority settings spin-boxes. 

- Andreas Persson just sent a patch that makes it possible to compile
  and run qjackctl with Qt version 4.1. Applied without hesitation,
  thanks.


0.3.1a  2007-07-19  System-tray tooltip icon crash fix.

- An immediate showstopper crash upon client start was irradicated,
  which was affecting those with the system-tray icon disabled,
  as is the default (thanks to Ken Ellinwood for first reporting
  this sloppy one).


0.3.1   2007-07-18  Shallowed bug-fix release.

- The current DSP load percentage activity is now also displayed on
  the system-tray icon tooltip.

- An illusive but nasty Connections/Patchbay item tooltip crash bug
  has been hopefully fixed (Qt >= 4.3).

- Now using QSystemTrayIcon class facility if available (Qt4 >= 4.2)
  making the system-tray option available on most platforms, notably
  on Windows and Mac OS X.

- Usage of QProcess class has been severely refactored, now using
  QProcess::start() instead of QProcess::startDetached(), giving
  much tighter control over the started jackd(mp) process. Downside
  is that QjackCtl lost its ability and option to leave the process
  detached upon quitting the application. Too bad.

- A new eye-candy bit has sneaked in: server mode display, that is 
  the RT indicator, now blinks when server/client is started/active.

- Combo-box setup history has been corrected on restore, which was
  discarding the very initial default (factory) contents.

- Now that Qt4 is accessible to open-source Windows appplications,
  there's some experimental stuff sneaking in for jackdmp support
  on win32 (http://www.grame.fr/~letz/jackdmp.html). 

- Connections list items were initially sorted in descending order
  by default. Fixed. Client items are now naturally sorted, again.


0.3.0   2007-07-10  Qt4 migration was complete.

- Qt4 migration was complete. Care must be taken with this new
  configuration file and location: this release starts a new one
  from scratch and won't reuse any of the previous existing ones,
  although cut and paste might help if you know what you're doing :)

- On a last-minute addition, the "firewire" audio backend driver
  option has been also included, supporting the ffado.org project
  which is evolving where "freebob" is leaving (thanks to Klaus
  Zimmermann for this one).


0.2.23   2007-07-02  JACK MIDI support debut.

- JACK MIDI support is now being introduced. Connections window
  now has a brand new MIDI tab, the older being renamed to ALSA,
  as for the ALSA/MIDI sequencer conveniency. The server settings
  now include the MIDI driver setup option (ALSA backend only).

- Application icon is now installed to ${prefix}/share/pixmaps;
  application desktop entry file is now included in installation;
  spec file (RPM) is now a bit more openSUSE compliant; initial
  debianization.

- Invalidation of the JACK client handle is now forced right on 
  jack_shutdown notification, preventing a most probable fatal
  crash due to jack_deactivate and/or jack_client_close being
  called after the jack_watchdog kicks in.

- Default font option names were adjusted to "Sans Serif" and
  "Monospace", wherever available.

- The "keep child windows always on top" option is not set as
  default anymore, because window focus behavior gets tricky
  on some desktop environments (eg. Mac OS X, Gnome).

- Autoconf (configure) scripting gets an update.


0.2.22   2007-03-31  Long overdue but better late than never.

- Fixed default settings for the freebob backend (JACK >= 0.103.0).

- CPU Load status label now says correctly DSP Load.

- The most recently used patchbay definitions can now be correctly
  selected in round-robin fashion from its drop-down list widget.

- Avoid mixing JACK MIDI ports with regular audio ports on the
  Connections and Patchbay widgets; strictly list only audio ports.

- Added 192k sample rate to setup settings drop down list (as kindly
  reminded by Klaus Zimmermann, thanks).

- Most top-level widgets were missing the normal-widget flag, which
  were causing some sticky size behavior on some window managers.


0.2.21   2006-10-07  Shrinking on screen real-estate.

- GPL address update.

- All window captions can now be set smaller as tool-widgets. This
  option takes effect when child windows are kept always on top.

- For the brave of heart, specially the ones brave enough to try with
  Stephane Letz's jackdmp, a win32 build should be now possible.

- The main window button text labels are now optional (after a kind
  suggestion by Geoff Beasley, thanks).

- Increse default maximum number of ports setting from 128 to 256.

- Initial freebob backend driver support. Also changed the coreaudio
  backend driver command line device name/id parameter.

- Closing the main window while not as an active JACK client, nor under
  a server running state, will just quit the whole application, even
  though the system-tray icon option is in effect.

- The most relevant transport commands (Rewind, Play and Pause) are now
  made available on the main window context popup menu.

- The post-shutdown script is now also being called when using the Stop
  button, whether the jackd server has been started internally or not.
  The initial hard-coded default is now on and set to `killall jackd`
  (as a workaround to an old request from Stephane Letz).

- The main window buttons display are now optional. One can choose
  whether the left, right and/or transport buttons are hidden, making
  it for a total of six different modes for the main window presentation
  (after a much simpler suggestion from Paul Davis and Stephane Letz).

- Added configure support for x86_64 libraries (UNTESTED).


0.2.20   2006-03-05  Featuring patchbay socket forwarding.

- Server path setting now accepts custom command line parameters
  (after a kind suggestion from Jussi Laako).

- The internal XRUN callback notification statistics and reporting has
  been changed to be a bit less intrusive.

- Patchbay socket dialog gets some more eye-candy as icons have been
  added to the client and plug selection (combobox) widgets.

- Connections and patchbay lines coloring has changed just slightly :)

- New patchbay socket forwarding feature. Any patchbay socket can now
  be set to have all its connections replicated (i.e. forwarded) to
  another one, which will behave actively as a clone of the former.
  Forward connections are shown by vertical directed colored lines,
  and can be selected either on socket dialog or from context menu
  (currently experimental, only applicable to input/writable sockets).

- Optional specification of alternate JACK and/or ALSA installation
  paths on configure time (after a patch from Lucas Brasilino, thanks).


0.2.19a  2005-11-28  MIDI aliases are back in town.

- ALSA sequencer client/port name aliases are functional again; all
  actual MIDI sequencer client/port numerical identifier prefixes are
  also back in business.


0.2.19   2005-11-19  MRU patchbay selection, Mac OS X and other fixes.

- Connections widget views are now properly refreshed after renaming
  client/ports (aliases).

- Disabled system tray and ALSA sequencer support on configure time,
  whenever building for MacOSX as default.

- Fixed the major issues with selecting an audio interface on Mac OSX;
  the button the right of the interface combo is now much better
  looking than it was before; input/output channel counts are also
  updated automatically now (thanks to Jesse Chappell for the patch).

- Prevent the setting of the coreaudio device id on the jackd command
  line (-n) whenever the default interface is being selected.

- The connections and patchbay windows are now allowed to have a wider
  connection lines frame panel; splitter width sizes are now persistent
  across application sessions (thanks to Filipe Tomas for the hint).

- Activation toggling feedback on the patchbay widget has been fixed;
  additionally and as found convenient, the most recently used patchbay
  definitions can now be loaded immediately by selecting from a drop-down
  list widget, which replaces the old static patchbay name status text,
  and adds a lil'icon too :)

- All widget captions changed to include proper application title prefix.

- Attempt to bring those aging autoconf templates to date; sample SPEC file
  for RPM build is now being included and generated at configure time.

- The current selected device is now shown with a checkmark on the
  device selection menu(s), while on the settings dialog.

- Set to use QApplication::setMainWidget() instead of registering the 
  traditional lastWindowClosed() signal to quit() slot, just to let
  the -geometry command line argument have some effect on X11.


0.2.18   2005-07-18  The mantra of bugfixes stays on.

- A freezing and endless loop condition on the patchbay socket item
  duplication (copy) has been fixed.

- Fixed output disability when messages limit option is turned off
  (thanks again to Wolfgang Woehl for spotting this one).


0.2.17   2005-06-17  Systemic I/O Latency settings are in.

- Systemic I/O Latency settings are now featured for the alsa, oss and
  coreaudio backends, letting you specify the known latency of external
  hardware for client aware compensation purposes (thanks to Wolfgang Woehl,
  for the reminder).

- Update on last backstage changes to the coreaudio backend options
  (due to Stephane Letz. Thanks).


0.2.16   2005-06-13  OSS device name selection and Mac OS X breakthrough.

- ALSA sequencer client/port name changes are now properly detected on the
  MIDI connections widget (as noted by Chris Cannam. Thanks).

- Long overdue transport buttons (rewind, backward and forward) finally 
  landed onto the main control window, at last :).

- Duplication (copy) of patchbay socket items was added.

- Do not ever try to start the JACK server if there's one already found
  running, on which case the client-only mode of operation is then activated
  (as kindly suggested by Orm Finnendahl, thanks).

- After several Mac OS X user requests, ALSA/MIDI sequencer support is
  now an option, otherwise detected at configure time and conditionally
  compiled in if, and only if, ALSA is found available (which has been
  a primordial assumption on Linux systems:). Ah, and that just makes
  for the blind inclusion of another backend driver option: coreaudio.

- Actual OSS device selection menu now featured on setup dialog; these
  adds to the device selection button menus for the OSS driver settings.

- Delayed geometry setup of windows upon startup was added as an optional
  workaround to subtle problems due to window decoration information not
  being available at window creation time on some window managers (as patch
  proposed by Dirk Jagdmann. Thanks).

- Fixed some minor but rather old bug that was quitting the application
  abruptly, when one switches off the system tray icon while the main
  application widget is hidden.

- Cancel is now an option when creating a new patchbay definition.

- Context menus are finally littered with icons.

- Minor configure and Makefile install fixes, as Debian and Mac OS X
  specialties. Also, install does the right thing with target file modes
  (thanks to Matt Flax and Ebrahim Mayat, for pointing these out).


0.2.15a  2005-02-09  Return of the paranoid.

- Regression from 0.2.13, of the not so stupid pseudo-mutex guards on the
  connections management framework, after fixing some crash reports from
  Fernando Pablo Lopez-Lezcano and Dave Phillips (thanks!); it pays to be
  such a paranoid after all :).


0.2.15   2005-02-06  Client/port names aliasing and other minors.

- JACK/ALSA client and port name aliasing (renaming) is now an optional
  feature for the connections window; all client/port aliases are saved
  on a per preset basis (as proposed for Lionstracs' Mediastation).

- Server state now shown (back gain) on the system tray icon tooltip; 
  speaking of which, tooltips are now also featured on connections, status
  and patchbay windows.

- New actual hardware device selection menu featured on setup dialog; these
  new button menus are only available for the ALSA driver settings.

- Server path factory default to jackd instead of jackstart; preset setup
  button icons are back.

- Fixed rare connection port item removal/disconnection dangling pointer bug.


0.2.14   2005-01-23  More progressive optimizations.

- Put a limit on XRUN callback messages and statistics report rate, preventing
  the potential hosing of the GUI due to a XRUN cascade storm. The maximum
  reasonable report rate has been fixed to be one XRUN callback occurrence 
  per second.

- Set to ignore the SIGPIPE ("Broken pipe") signal, where available, as the
  default handler is usually fatal when a JACK client is zombified abruptly.

- All conection view items are now sorted in natural case insensitive order,
  not just as audio port names as was before.

- Got rid of those nonsense paranoid and rather stupid pseudo-mutex guards on 
  the connections management framework and event notifications (nuff said :).

- Optional confirmation warning on audio server shutdown, if there's some
  audio clients still active and connected (as suggested by Sampo Savolainen).

- Check for <jack/statistics.h> on configure time (as of JACK 0.99.42+ CVS).

- "Unlock memory" server setup option was added, allowing the release
  of memory used by common toolkit libraries (GTK+, Qt, FLTK, Wine) that
  were being superfluously locked on every GUI JACK client; number of periods
  has now the minimum allowed value of 2; server start delay widget converted
  to spinbox; setup dialog layout slighly changed.

- Removed stand-alone usx2y driver support. Since JACK 0.99.41+ CVS, the
  special "rawusb" support on the Tascam US-122/224/428 USB Audio/MIDI
  interface controllers have been merged and properly integrated into the
  regular alsa backend driver. Being still experimental, this special mode
  of operation is now triggered only when "hw:N,2" is specified as the alsa
  device name (N = soundcard index of snd-usb-usx2y module).

- Messages window limit is now enforced only when the line count exceeds
  in one third the user configured line count maximum; if Qt 3.2.0+ is in use,
  the QTextView widget is otherwise set to the optimized Qt::LogText format.

- XRUN status items are kept double-dashed if none has been detected.


0.2.13   2004-11-21  Retouches and minor optimizations.

- Main window is now properly minimized instead of simply hidden when
  the system tray icon is not available nor opted in (as suggested
  by Florian Schmidt).

- Some informational status items are now updated 10 times less frequently
  (e.g. CPU Load, Sample Rate, Buffer Size, Realtime Mode, etc.), lowering
  the CPU burden of most probably redundant status updates.

- XRUN detection and statistics are being conditionally included if
  jack_get_xrun_delayed_usecs() is available (as of JACK 0.99.7+ CVS).

- Fixed ancient bug on client shutdown event handling, which was
  invoking the xrun notification handler by mistake.

- Support for maximum scheduling delay status added; this status relies
  on jack_get_max_delayed_usecs() function availability at configure time,
  depending on a Lee Revell's non-official JACK patch.

- Patchbay Activate button is now a toggle button widget, allowing the
  deactivation of the current patchbay profile.

- Reset-status icon has been changed to a simple red circle instead of
  previous one which was much like a power-switch symbol.

- Preset selection has been added to the context menu.


0.2.12a  2004-10-11  Audio connections now naturally sorted.

- Client port list on audio connections are now hopefully fixed for good;
  the sort comparison function now takes full natural order into account.


0.2.12   2004-10-08  Larger icons and font option on connections/patchbay.

- Fixed some old and slow memory-leak due to redundand and repetitive call
  to jack_port_by_name() (discovered and solved, thanks to Jesse Chappell);
  some other free() and configure fixes were also applied.

- Shiny display effect toggling has immediate feedback on setup dialog.

- Added new usx2y driver support.

- New scaled connections/patchbay icons were added; meanwhile, all inline
  XPM icons were removed and brainlessly converted to PNG format.

- New setup options as for the connections/patchbay view apprearence: larger
  icon sizes and font selection are now possible, to better ease manipulation
  on a touchscreen (feature requested for Lionstracs' Mediastation).

- Connection line width follows icon size in discrete proportion.

- "Other" setup options moved to a new dialog tab, "Misc"; new extreme item
  values, 32 and 16 frames, added to the drop-down list of the Frames/Buffer
  setting (as suggested by Mark Knetch).


0.2.11   2004-09-10  Shiny display now optional and other fixes.

- Fixed Input/Output channels settings, being now either enabled when
  the ALSA driver is selected for Capture/Playback only.

- Shiny display effect: after some conservative user complaints this 
  pure cosmetic feature is now made optional ;)


0.2.10   2004-09-04  Shiny display and curved connections.

- New pre-shutdown script setup option, allowing to specify a shell-script
  to be run before the JACK server daemon is shutted-down. This overrides
  any previous shutdown script setting, which should be now moved onto the
  existing post-shutdown script option, as to keep old procedural behaviour.

- Avoid stopping JACK prematurely with QProcess::kill() (oneliner fix);
  stopping JACK will now take a little bit longer, but hopefully will take
  the time to cleanup properly (thanks to Kjetil Matheussen).

- ALSA driver Duplex mode accepts alternate Input or Output device name.

- Context menu reset option is now always enabled (yet another suggestion
  from Sampo Savolainen).

- Main display background gets shinny effect; adjusted system tray background 
  palette color mode.

- Priority and setup control is now a spinbox ranging from 0..89 (as 
  suggested by Florian Schmidt). Same for Periods/Buffer.

- Patchbay connection lines are now drawn correctly when items are
  scrolled out of view. Additionally, the connection lines can now be
  optionally drawn as bezier spline curves (big thanks to Wilfried Huss).


0.2.9   2004-07-04  Sloppy boy fixes and minor featuritis.

- Patchbay socket dialog client and plug list option items are now
  properly escaped as regular expressions.

- JACK callbacks are now internally mapped to QCustomeEvent's instead
  of using the traditional pipe notifications.
  
- The system tray popup menu is now featured as a context menu on the
  main application window too.

- The reset status option is now included in the system tray popup menu.

- Server stop command button now enabled during client startup interval;
  this makes it possible to stop the server just in case the client 
  can't be activated for any reason.

- Top level sub-windows are now always raised and set with active focus
  when shown to visibility.


0.2.8   2004-04-30  System tray icon and menu option.

- New option for system tray icon and menu, which is known to be effective
  on KDE enabled desktops; support for freedesktop.org's system tray protocol
  specification has been included so this maybe also effective on Gnome2.

- Capture or Playback-only optional alternate device interface name may now
  be specified for the ALSA audio driver server settings.

- Maximum number of ports setting was added to server setup.

- The dash (-) is now a legal character for preset names.


0.2.7b  2004-04-05  OSS driver setup fix.

- OSS driver halfduplex setup operation is now fixed, thanks to
  Jussi Laako.


0.2.7a  2004-04-05  Compilation fix for Qt 3.1.

- QSplitter::setChildrenCollapsible call is now conditionally compiled, 
  applied only on Qt 3.2+.


0.2.7   2004-04-04  User-interface refinements and OSS driver support.

- Connections and patchbay windows horizontal layout are now user
  configurable via splitter widgets.

- Refresh on connections window now take effect on both tabs, Audio
  (JACK) and MIDI (ALSA).

- OSS driver support and no-mlock option added to server settings, setup
  dialog (as of JACK 0.95.7+).

- Temporary server configuration option added, applicable to the auto-start
  server feature on client applications, whether the server shall exit once
  all clients are closed.

- Server mode (RT) status display added.

- Warning messages are now prompted to the user when there are any pending
  changes not saved nor applied while on the setup dialog.

- Translation support for the default preset name "(default)".

- Messages window pops up whenever a critical error message is issued.


0.2.6   2004-02-29  More work in progress.

- Message window line limit is now a configurable option on setup, as is
  whether the command-line local configuration file gets saved at all;
  the first argument of the command-line configuration is stuffed
  to be the executable server command absolute path, when possible. 

- Warning message issued if ALSA sequencer is not available on startup;
  also if server settings are changed while client is currently active.

- Server autostart magic is locally disabled by forcing the environment 
  variable JACK_NO_START_SERVER at startup; with any luck this will
  maintain qjackctl's behaviour whether the JACK server is already 
  started or not.

- Makefile.cvs makes its late entrance on the build toolset.


0.2.5  2004-02-16  Server survival option and command-line wrapper feature.

- New option on application exit for leaving the JACK server daemon running,
  surviving the parent process; the confirmation prompt on application close
  now features a "Terminate", "Leave" and "Cancel" button options.

- New command-line wrapper feature for JACK client applications, thus
  giving a convenient head start for the JACK audio server as needed
  (as suggested by Fernando Pablo Lopez-Lezcano, of Planet CCRMA fame).

- Messages, Status, Connections and Patchbay pop-up windows are not hinted 
  as dialogs anymore and thus are not centered relative to parent main window 
  which has become a strict Qt dialog widget behaviour (as of Qt 3.3+).

- Patchbay window content changes are now properly updated, without the need
  for a later manual refresh to redraw stalled connection lines.

- The snapshot option for creating a new patchbay definition from current
  actual connections now takes client and port names as regular expressions
  and smart enough when regarding more than two contiguous decimal digits :)

- Patchbay socket list view ordering is now properly preserved; socket
  dialog gets plug list handling ehancements; active patchbay gets reloaded
  when commited and saved to file; connections redraw on socket removal has
  been fixed.

- Server literal command-line is now saved into local configuration file
  (~/.jackdrc) for convenience of future auto-start client applications.

- New setup option on whether all child windows are kept on top of the main
  window, or otherwise floating with probable taskbar entries of their own.

- Setup changes that are only effective next time the program is run gets
  an informational message box shown to the user.


0.2.4  2004-02-01  Exclusive patchbay sockets.

- Patchbay definitions may now be configured with exclusive sockets;
  this way, only one defined connection is allowed as soon as it's available,
  being all others immediatelly disconnected whenever attempted.

- On the connections view, current connected client ports are now slightly
  highlighted (blue) whenever a client or port is selected on the opposite
  column (as suggested by Lawrie Abbott).

- Connections and patchbay drag and drop feature is now bilateral; you can
  now drag and drop an item from right to left to establish the connection.


0.2.3a 2004-01-19  Time format combo-box tooltip fix.

- A qt-designer copy-paste leftover has been fixed; sloppy boy I am ;)


0.2.3  2004-01-19  Tenths, hundredths, milliseconds, whatever.

- Custom time format setup for all elapsed times, allowing the display
  of tenths, hundredths or even milliseconds instead of just hundredths
  of second for transport time code.


0.2.2   2004-01-16  Hundredths are back.

- Transport time is now shown with hundredths of second (hh:mm:ss.dd),
  as it was once before but not constant zero.

- Client start delay now configurable on setup; this may be of help for
  slow machines or unusual long server driver startups (e.g. portaudio).

- Client-only mode restart has been fixed.

- Messages color retouching.

- Popup menus memory leak fixed.


0.2.1   2003-12-29  The fix of fixes.

- Fixed jackstart/jackd command line parameter argument concatenation.

- Front panel status display font can now be customized.

- Some connection graph changes were being silently missed, now fixed.

- Messages window fallback fix; stdout handling has been retouched to
  be more line buffer oriented.


0.2.0   2003-12-12  ALSA sequencer patchbay entrance.

- ALSA sequencer subscription patchbay feature, complementing current
  audio service with a MIDI application connection graph, gracefuly
  included on the same front-end.

- Current preset name is shown on main window caption title. New button
  and form icons. Messages window blankness rendering fix.

- Immediate server startup option was made persistent and therefore
  remembered across sessions.

- Standard output/error stream capture setup option.


0.1.3   2003-11-26  Server settings profile/preset feature.

- Server setup settings can now be profiled, named and saved as presets.
  Command line preset name option and scripting argument meta-symbols are
  also featured for convenience (kindly suggested by Sampo Savolainen).

- New configure time argument debugging support (--enable-debug).


0.1.2   2003-11-16  More work in progress.

- Qmake project file (qjackctl.pro) now generated by configure (autoconf),
  introducing the explicit binding support to libqt-mt (multi-thread).

- Main window is not hinted as a dialog anymore, giving room to the minimize
  button on some other window managers; application close confirm warning is
  now an option.

- Removed deprecated settings options: temporary directory and ASIO mode;
  new available settings for the ALSA driver: force 16bit format, maximum
  input channels and output channels (as of JACK 0.90.x).

- Transport time display looses static hundredth seconds decimal digits.


0.1.1a  2003-11-01  Whatever happened to OK button icons.

- Restored missing OK button icons.


0.1.1   2003-10-29  Minor feature enhancements and bugfixes.

- Main window display items are now made fixed in width, at least those more
  prone to change frequently and thus caused some display jitter.

- Messages, status, connections and patchbay module windows are now reopened
  automagicaly on startup as they were on previous session.

- New patchbay definition snapshot option from current actual connections;
  current active patchbay filename status indication on title.

- New icons patchbay editor window and socket dialogs; own stdout/stdin is
  now properly captured and shown on messages log window.

- Fixed an obvious patchbay connection scan freezing bug; default .xml file
  extension enforcement on save.


0.1.0   2003-10-22  Major user interface redesign.

- Main application window complete redesign, now more like a multimedia/LCD
  control panel -- old main window dialog tabs are now splitted in separate
  pop-up windows/dialogs; big time display options. In other words, this sums
  up to a nice complete application rewrite.

- Deprecated options for forcing aRTs and jackd daemons are no longer
  available; this functionality can be officially superceded by the more
  generic startup/shutdown script options.

- Seamless support for externally started JACK server, providing a client-only
  mode of operation; if the JACK daemon is already started, qjackctl enters in
  client detached mode automagically.

- Messages window font is configurable and saved across sessions (by Jack
  O'Quin's humble request). Some colorization has been introduced on some
  event messages.

- Preliminary patchbay persistence feature is under way. A patchbay definition
  editor is already included, following an alternative socket-plug patchbay
  model that aliases and is a direct map to the client-port JACK connections
  model. The patchbay definitions are stored as text/xml files.

- New post-startup script option; immediate JACK server startup command line
  option (as suggested by Kasper Souren).


0.0.9a  2003-10-03  Tiny bugfixes.

- Startup/shutdown script options now correctly saved and restored.

- Dummy driver wait parameter is now properly set on startup.

- Confirmation warning on disconnecting all ports (as suggested by Robert
  Jonsson).


0.0.9   2003-09-25  Work in progress.

- New connection port item pixmaps that distinguishes physical from
  logical ports.

- History of most recently used values gets saved for some settings
  and options comboboxes widgets.

- New startup and shutdown script options, intended to supersede the
  mess of forcing artsd and jackd itself, in a near future ;) this way,
  one can also include the operation of the LADCCA daemon (following a
  suggestion from Kasper Souren).

- Connections command buttons are now shortly disabled after clicking,
  avoiding accidental duplicated connections.


0.0.8   2003-09-19  Preliminary transport and buffer size status control.

- Transport status and control introduced (requires JACK 0.80.0+);

- Statistics tab renamed to Status, where the transport state info and
  simple play/pause control buttons are now placed;

- Buffer size status is yet another item on the list view.


0.0.7   2003-09-15  Minor bugfixes.

- Inverse alphabetic ordering fixed on Connections port listing.

- Verbose option added; messages view font size fix; about Qt dialog;
  logo pixmap retouched.

- Configure script now checks for Qt 3.1.1 or greater.


0.0.6   2003-09-12  Drag-n-drop and more feature enhancements and bufixes.

- Patchbay connection user interface handling has been fairly rewritten;
  (features new bugs while fixing old ones ;-)

- Reset XRUN statistics button added; reset time recorded on statistics;
  calculated latency is now shown on settings; ASIO mode disables
  Periods/Buffer setting (all suggestions by Lawrie Abbott).

- Context popup menu introduced for port connection handling; includes
  new command for disconnecting all currently connected ports.

- Closing the application while JACK is running, is now presented with a
  warning confirmation message (preventing accidental Esc key press? :).

- Patchbay port lists ordering are now more numerical-friendly than ever,
  taking account for sub-numbering port names (following yet another
  suggestion from Lawrie).

- Connection drag-and-drop is now featured after many, many requests.

- Corrected the configure script to properly recognize Qt 3.0.1 or greater.


0.0.5   2003-09-05  Minor feature enhancements and bugfixes.

- Internationalization support added; future qjackctl_${LANG}.qm translation
  files are located on ${prefix}/share/locale .

- New dummy and portaudio driver support (as of JACK release 0.80.0+).

- A couple of silent memory leak bugs have been corrected.


0.0.4   2003-08-29  Minor changes and bugfixes.

- The patchbay port lists are now sorted in a more numerical friendly manner
  (as suggested by Steve Harris); the sort code has been "borrowed" from
  qjackconnect, yet again.

- Patchbay port connection lines are now always visible, even if their
  respective connected port items aren't.

- Multiple simultaneous port connections can now be handled when a client
  application item is selected for connection/disconnection (again, suggested
  by Steve Harris), replicating and extending qjackconnect's similar behaviour.

- An auto-refresh option for the patchbay connections is now available,
  for those cases when client code just can't handle properly some callbacks.

- Window positioning and sizing is now almost persistent across sessions;
  as before, position is saved for the minimal view mode; but now, the details
  dialog view mode gets its position and size independantly saved also.


0.0.3   2003-08-07  Integrated visual patchbay.

- A patchbay for jack port connections is now integrated, much like the
  greatest Mathias Nagorni's qjackconnect (http://www.suse.de/~mana/jack.html).


0.0.2   2003-08-02  Client code features introduced.

- JACK library and header files are checked on configure.

- Server CPU load, sample rate and time elapsed since last XRUN
  detected, are now displayed on statistics.


0.0.1   2003-07-26  Initial release.
