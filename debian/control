Description: JACK Audio Connection Kit Qt GUI Interface.
  QjackCtl is a simple Qt application to control the JACK sound server
  (http://jackaudio.org), for the Linux Audio infrastructure.
  Written in C++ around the Qt framework for X11, most exclusively
  using Qt Designer. Provides a simple GUI dialog for setting several
  JACK server parameters, which are properly saved between sessions,
  and a way control of the status of the audio server. With time, this
  primordial interface has become richer by including a enhanced
  patchbay and connection control features.
